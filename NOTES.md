# Notes for the authors:

We have to go back into the data after receiving the wines to ensure that the dryness and sweetness estimations were accurate to true values. This should be done following receipt of the wines and added to columns like acidity and brix.

1, sweet
2, semi-sweet
3, semi-dry
4, dry

1, white
2, rose
3, red
